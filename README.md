# PHY180
NOTE: First project using LaTeX
First lab project of the 2022 Fall term. Conducted multiple lab experiments using at-home setups for determining the relationship between 
pendulum behaviours and changing conditions such as length of string. 
Although it was optional, learning LaTeX proved to produce a much cleaner and professional-looking report, as well as an easier way to manage citations.
